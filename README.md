# Forbidden Love
Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create
The project depicts the harsh reality of colourism and casteism within South Asian culture.
(Caste encompasses a complex ordering of social groups on the basis of ritual purity. A person is considered a member of the caste into which he or she is born and remains within that caste until death, although the particular ranking of that caste may vary among regions and over time. Differences in status are traditionally justified by the religious doctrine of karma, a belief that one's place in life is determined by one's deeds in previous lifetimes.)

The projects aims to give the user the experience of seeing this reality through the perspective of a "dark-skinned" South Asian boy. The first panel opens with a glimpse into the world of casual colourism that exists within South Asian societies. Our protagonist - Kashif - is an exploratory mind asking the hard questions and trying to dispel these backward notions. The root of this problem is described concisely through the interchange between Kashif and his friends who reply by saying that colourist thought was ingrained in them since thei childhood by their parents, and they are made to realize that they never actually qeustioned the thought, hence propagating the thought. 
The rest of the story follows the journey of Kashif through his university life when he first approaches matured and liberal thought amongst his generation through his girlfriend Layla and friend circle. He is finally able to forget about this harsh reeality through a beautiful love story and friendship. Aspects of this deeply-rooted colourism are still shown to the user through the disadvantages that Kashif faces in obtaining a job and the lower benefits that he receives. Kashif's story ends through the terrible exchange he has with Layla (which in reality were her parents writing the texts). This is quite realistic and portrays the reality of consrvative South Asian households where something as personal as love and marriageare still largely influenced and dictated by one's family.
